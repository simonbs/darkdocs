# Dark Docs

**The project have been archived as Apple's documentation now support dark mode by default.**

----

Sitting in your bed hacking on your app at night? Then you're probably frustrated that Apple's developer documentation doesn't support dark mode.

This Safari extension adds support for dark mode on developer.apple.com/documentation and developer.apple.com/search. The appearance of the documentation will respect your system setting.
