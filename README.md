# Dark Docs

Sitting in your bed hacking on your iOS app at night? Then you're probably frustrated that Apple's developer documentation doesn't support dark mode.

This Safari extension adds support for dark mode on developer.apple.com/documentation. The appearance of the documentation will respect your system setting.
